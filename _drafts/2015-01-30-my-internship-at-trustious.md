summary : "Networks? Yeah I think it's cool. Distributed Systems? I want to try it. Machine Learning? Sure! I'll take the machine learning course on coursera and I'll start building my first recommender. Kernel Hacking? Yes it's kernel hacking I want to be a kernel hacker! Whenever I find something new, I get excited and start reading about it for a while and then nothing. That's when I got an internship offer from Trustious."

Networks? Yeah I think it's cool. Distributed Systems? I want to try it. Machine Learning? Sure! I'll take the machine learning course on coursera and I'll start building my first recommender. Kernel Hacking? Yes it's kernel hacking I want to be a kernel hacker! Whenever I find something new, I get excited and start reading about it for a while and then nothing. OK, Let's ask a question on Quora maybe I'll get some help. Honestly most of the answers weren't helpful at all. Most of them suggested that I should switch fields. I guess they didn't get what I was asking about. But one answer suggested something that I think is correct to a big extent.

The answer made sense. I've never for example worked on anything related to machine learning before but I saw its applications and they are cool that's why I wanted to learn about it. It's not bad at all to learn about something cause it's cool, the problem is that it wasn't interesting enough for me to spend my time learning more about it. That's when I got an internship offer from [Trustious](http://www.trustious.com/). I knew about Trustious before as some of my friends did an internship there. I knew about how good the team there was. I spent some time thinking about it and then I accepted the offer. I can say that this was one of the best decisions I took in 2014.

Working with such a great team is awesome! I finished my three-month internship and continued as a part-timer throughout my 7th semester. The thing that affected me the most was that ***I found my passion***. I love writing scripts, I love automating things, I love managing servers and I love the infrastructure work. I still can't find the suitable title for this job but at least that's the job description.

One more thing that is worth mentioning is those tournament days. Those days when we come to the office just to have fun :D I played some new games like [Jenga Boom](http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-A2028-Jenga-Boom/dp/B009H0EFGE), [Therapy](http://www.amazon.com/Pressman-Therapy-The-Game/dp/B000IUA1AQ), [Start Flux](http://www.amazon.ca/Looney-Lab-star-flux-game/dp/B005WGPZWU) - I love this one - and others. I played Pictionary, they knew about my amazing drawing skills as you may see in the picture below. I played bowling with empty plastic water bottles and I lost many PlayStation Gladiator Duels while using [Playstation Move](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Move) for the first time.

I can write a separate blog post about the technical things I learned at Trustious but I'll try to mention them here briefly. First of all, I started using Vim and tmux as my default development environment. My bash knowledge was almost doubled. I learned about docker and started using it heavily. I developed a distributed docker-based test parallelization framework in bash. I learned about caching and got the opportunity introduce lots of changes to the caching infrastructure. I learned about A/B testing and feature toggles and developed a rails library for each of them. I learned about Jenkins and designed the CI system. I helped in building our small in-office testing cluster <3. I couldn't have learned or got exposed to all of this without the supervision of this awesome team.

*So why am I writing this blog post?* I'm writing it just to say thanks.
