title: The distributed R Console
summary : "As a data science startup, we write a lot of R scripts. Since we often work with very large amounts of data, our R scripts usually have high CPU and Memory usage. Moreover, these R scripts may take hours or even days to finish. It doesn’t, therefore, make sense to run them on our workstations. That’s why we built a tool to schedule and run R scripts on a one-click deployable on-demand cluster."
