[![Pocket](/img/favorite-articles-2018/pocket.png)](/img/favorite-articles-2018/pocket.png){:: data-lightbox="img3"}

 I've been reading a lot of tech articles and blogs recently. Those articles are mostly from either [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), reddit's [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/), Pocket's explore tab or the people I follow on twitter and facebook. I save them to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) and read them later on during my daily commute.

I decided to share some of those I found interesting over the past year. I skimmed through my pocket's archive and compiled this list. It doesn't contain the stuff I read that didn't go through Pocket though.

- [Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html). I've learned a lot reading this article. It's one of my favourites for this year.
- [Network Protocols for anyone who knows a programming language](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium/network-protocols?share_key=97d3ba4c24d21147). The Ethernet part was very interesting.
- [Building a Distributed Log from Scratch](https://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-1-storage-mechanics/). Given that I've recently joined a team that built a distributed log ([Logdevice](https://github.com/facebookincubator/LogDevice)) from scratch, this series was a very interesting read to me.
- [A Cascading Failure of Distributed Systems](https://medium.com/@daniel.p.woods/on-infrastructure-at-scale-a-cascading-failure-of-distributed-systems-7cff2a3cd2df). A story of an intermittent connectivity issue that took down a whole cluster at Target.
- [Everything You Need To Know About Networking On AWS](https://grahamlyons.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-networking-on-aws).
- [How do you cut a monolith in half?](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/162346490883/how-do-you-cut-a-monolith-in-half).
- And why you might want to glue it back : [Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/).
- Github talking about their MySQL High availability setup: [MySQL High Availability at GitHub](https://githubengineering.com/mysql-high-availability-at-github/).
- [A plain english introduction to CAP Theorem](http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/).
- [How to write a good software design doc?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-a-good-software-design-document-66fcf019569c)
- What's a memory allocator and how to build a simple one? [Memory Allocators 101 - Write a simple memory allocator](https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/148675821737/memory-allocators-101-write-a-simple-memory).
- What would you do if you find a RaspberryPi in your network closet? [The curious case of the Raspberry Pi in the network closet](https://blog.haschek.at/2018/the-curious-case-of-the-RasPi-in-our-network.html).
- [Why NOT to Build a Time-Series Database](https://www.outlyer.com/blog/why-not-to-build-a-time-series-database/). Spoiler alert: It's hard.
- [Proving the correctness of two phase commit using TLA+](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/12/2-phase-commit-and-beyond.html). It was my first time I've heard about TLA+ and I was impressed.
- How CockroachDB managed to build a SQL engine on top of a distributed key value store : [SQL in CockroachDB: Mapping Table Data to Key-Value Storage](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/sql-in-cockroachdb-mapping-table-data-to-key-value-storage/).
- Saher's post about [living on the edge](https://medium.com/whizardry/living-on-the-edge-node-456a8e969860) and Lara's post [about personalized alerting](https://medium.com/whizardry/an-error-alerting-system-of-ones-own-d3850781ca18). Their blog posts are very well written! Follow [their blog](https://medium.com/whizardry)!
- Cloudflare's blog posts are usually very interesting. Those are the two I found in my archive: [Every 7.8μs your computer’s memory has a hiccup](https://blog.cloudflare.com/every-7-8us-your-computers-memory-has-a-hiccup/) and [Cloud Computing without Containers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloud-computing-without-containers/).
- "Most people in the tech industry are brainwashed by Silicon Valley group think. These people believe that every business must have a billion dollar opportunity. This isn’t true, especially for side projects." - a quote from [How I Built A $5,000 Per Month Side Project](https://campfirelabs.co/blog-1/2019/1/10/how-i-built-a-5000-per-month-side-project).
- Fatih (who used to be the maintainer of vim-go), writes about [his experience using an iPad Pro as his development machine](https://arslan.io/2019/01/07/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine/).
- The two 2018 recaps that motivated me to write my own (which I'm still writing): Fatih's [Recap Year 2018](https://arslan.io/2018/12/29/recap-year-2018/) and Mosab's [2018: State of the Union](https://medium.com/@mos3abof/2018-state-of-the-union-f71deb220447).
- And finally, [The Best Fat Loss Article on the Motherfuckin’ Internet](http://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/). That's not how I'm describing it, that's actually the name of the article.

Let me know if you think this is useful and maybe then I can do it frequently.
